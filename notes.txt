A fullTextAnnotation is a structured hierarchical response for the UTF-8 text extracted from the image, organized as Pages→Blocks→Paragraphs→Words→Symbols:

Page is a collection of blocks, plus meta-information about the page: sizes, resolutions (X resolution and Y resolution may differ).

Block represents one "logical" element of the page—for example, an area covered by text, or a picture or separator between columns. The text and table blocks contain the main information needed to extract the text.

Paragraph is a structural unit of text representing an ordered sequence of words. By default, words are considered to be separated by word breaks.

Word is the smallest unit of text. It is represented as an array of Symbols.

Symbol represents a character or a punctuation mark.
